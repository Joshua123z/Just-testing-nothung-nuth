<h1>UNBLOCK3R</h1>
This uses the property that many text servers can only handle so many characters. This exploit adds "#" and then a very very long string of letters, successfully crashing the server while not changing the functionality of the page. It is with a similar concept as the among us exploit, however, this one is more practical. Currently, the index.html is not working because of minor bugs, but the bookmarklet version (index.js) is working perfectly. <br>
The bookmarklet can be executed on any site. <br>
NOTE: This may not work with some blockers because they can handle more letters. <br>
This has minor glitches with certain sites, such as Pokemon Showdown, as they read the letters after the "#". However, this is fine, since it just displays a warning message.
